Subject: Merge Strategy and Build Process for "feature/Dia-Rewards-with-SLAS" Branch in STGTEST

Team,

I hope you're doing well. I want to streamline our approach for integrating SLAS and Dia Rewards changes in STGTEST.

We've created a new branch named "feature/Dia-Rewards-with-SLAS" to facilitate this process. Here's the plan: we'll merge updates from both "feature/brand-dia-rewards" and "AZ-18823-SLAS" branches into "feature/Dia-Rewards-with-SLAS." This way, we consolidate all relevant changes into one branch for testing.

As for the build process, we'll deploy the "feature/Dia-Rewards-with-SLAS" branch to STGTEST. But we'll only initiate the build when there are new changes committed to either "feature/brand-dia-rewards" or "AZ-18823-SLAS." This ensures that our STGTEST build always reflects the latest updates from both branches.

By following this streamlined approach, we'll enhance collaboration and efficiency in validating SLAS and Dia Rewards changes in STGTEST.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
